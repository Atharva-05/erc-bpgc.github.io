title: Mini Projects

description: 'The best way to learn is to get your hands dirty. Keeping this in mind, we have prepared a set of mini-projects for you to dive into the field of robotics. Together, the projects cover a wide variety of fields so that there is something to try, no matter what your area of interest.  

The projects are designed to be completed in 5-6 weeks in small teams. Each project has been allotted ERC members as mentors. Every week, you will be given resources to learn about and practice a concept required to complete the project. The mentors will be there to solve your doubts and help you troubleshoot. They will also hold weekly meetings to take project updates and help out with any problems.

This will be a great opportunity not only to develop new skills but also to get to know ERC members. We will be looking out for those of you who show enthusiasm throughout the projects to be inducted into the club. And while we’ll do our best to provide guidance, ultimately it will be up to you to learn and put in the effort to complete the project.

How to sign up -
Read about the available projects at erc-bpgc.github.io/mini_projects
Fill the form at forms.gle/bPfpXmnLWmfYkins7
Attend the intro session on Tuesday 26th Jan (timing will be announced soon)

Note: To apply for more than one project, you may submit this form multiple times (though you can only take a maximum of two projects).

				<p>Arduino is an open-source prototyping platform in electronics based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It is a microcontroller-based prototyping board capable of developing digital devices that can read inputs like a finger on a button, touch on a screen, light on a sensor etc.
                The obstacle avoiding car is one of the simplest beginner’s robotics projects. We will learn how to control a differential drive robot, which uses an ultrasonic distance sensor to detect obstacles and steer clear of them.

					<h3>Chebyshev Lambda Mechanism</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
				A mechanical linkage is an assembly of bodies connected to manage forces and movement.
                A kinematic chain, in which one link is fixed or stationary, is called a mechanism.
                Linkages are an integral part of robotics in fact The skeletons of robotic systems are examples of spatial linkages.
                This project aims to design and create a walking robot based on Chebyshev Lambda Mechanism. Also, learn how to use most of the tools and features of Solidworks or Fusion360 since we will do the robot’s mechanical design and assembly on Solidworks or Fusion360.

					<h3>Robot Gripper and Arm</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
				If you think of a simple industrial robot as consisting of an arm, with an 'elbow' and a 'wrist' for motion and a 'hand' for picking things up, you're not being childish –in fact, you're thinking like a roboticist. Industrial robot 'arms', as they are called, do have elbows and wrists. And, at the end of the arm, robots are often fitted with what are called grippers – special devices designed to help robots handle objects in the real world. 
                This project aims to design and create a conceptual Robot arm along with its gripper. Also, learn how to use most of the tools and features of Solidworks or Fusion360 since we will do the robot’s mechanical design and assembly on Solidworks or Fusion360.

				Path planning, which is basically formulating a path from the starting point to the goal point in a given environment is one of the most fundamental aspects of navigation in any form, and is used extensively throughout robotics.
                In this project, you will be learning different algorithms used for planning paths, the math behind why the algorithms work and implement them from scratch.

				Neural networks have revolutionized what we can do with Machine Learning. Combined with Reinforcement Learning is allowing robots to learn a complex range of behaviors - opening up a wide range of possibilities for the field. 
				In this project we’ll learn the maths behind Neural Networks and implement our own one from scratch to emulate simple logical functions. We’ll also learn about

					<h3>Computer Vision based Line Follower</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
				A line follower robot is a robot which follows a particular line made on the ground by using a feedback mechanism. With the advent of fields such as Deep Learning, there has been an increasing usage of Computer Vision in robotics for perception. 
                In this project, you will be making a line following-robot which uses computer vision to detect the line and follow it instead of primitive sensor based methods.
